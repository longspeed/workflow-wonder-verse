# Build and Deployment Standards

## Objective
Establish consistent build and deployment practices to ensure reliable and efficient application delivery.

## Context
- Vite for build tooling
- TypeScript compilation
- Environment configuration
- Performance optimization
- Error tracking with Sentry

## Rules

### Build Process
- Use Vite for development and production builds
- Enable TypeScript compilation checks
- Implement proper environment variable handling
- Optimize bundle size
- Generate source maps for production

### Environment Configuration
- Use `.env` files for environment variables
- Implement proper environment validation
- Keep sensitive data out of version control
- Document required environment variables
- Use type-safe environment configuration

### Performance Optimization
- Implement code splitting
- Optimize asset loading
- Use proper caching strategies
- Minimize bundle size
- Implement proper lazy loading

### Error Tracking
- Configure Sentry for error tracking
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log errors appropriately
- Monitor performance metrics
- Track user interactions

### Deployment
- Implement proper CI/CD pipeline
- Use semantic versioning
- Document deployment process
- Implement rollback strategy
- Monitor deployment health

## Exceptions
- Allow development-only features
- Document any build-time exceptions
- Justify any performance trade-offs
